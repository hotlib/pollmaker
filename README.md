# pollmaker
This project is a simple website for making surveys (for example in a company). A admin can login in and create a survey. He creates
one-time access credentails for users, so they can participate in a survey.

###Status
There are no style sheets and the evaluation of poll results is missing. This project **is just an experiment** for now it is not intended for real use.
